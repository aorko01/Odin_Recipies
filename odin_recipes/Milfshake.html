    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A milkshake is a creamy and indulgent beverage made by blending together
      milk, ice cream, and various flavorings. The classic milkshake consists of
      vanilla ice cream, milk, and sweet syrup, but a wide array of flavors such
      as chocolate, strawberry, and caramel can be incorporated to create
      diverse taste experiences. The ingredients are blended until smooth,
      resulting in a thick, frothy, and refreshing drink. Milkshakes are often
      garnished with whipped cream, sprinkles, or a cherry on top, enhancing
      their visual appeal and overall decadence. Served chilled, milkshakes are
      a beloved treat enjoyed by people of all ages around the world.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The origins of milkshakes can be traced back to the late 19th century.
      Initially, milkshakes were alcoholic beverages, containing whiskey and
      sometimes eggs, served at soda fountains and bars. However, by the early
      20th century, the non-alcoholic version gained popularity, especially in
      the United States. In the 1920s, the electric blender was invented,
      revolutionizing the preparation of milkshakes and ensuring a smoother,
      creamier texture.

      During the mid-20th century, milkshakes became a staple in diners and
      fast-food restaurants, often accompanying burgers and fries. The 1950s, in
      particular, saw the rise of milkshakes as a symbol of American pop
      culture, frequently depicted in movies and advertisements. Over the years,
      milkshakes have continued to evolve, with creative variations
      incorporating different ice cream flavors, fruits, and toppings, catering
      to diverse tastes and preferences. Today, milkshakes are enjoyed
      worldwide, both in traditional form and as innovative, gourmet creations
